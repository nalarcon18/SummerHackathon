Summer Hackathon

What this project does is that it helpes the person know what they can do over
the summer. For example if you press on the button Movie it would
take you to another page which lists a couple of movies the person
can watch over the summer. However this also lists a bunch of activities
the person can do in the city for example for the Food section for the person
it lists a couple of recipes they can do over the summer.

We built this project by using things like bootstrap on the medium 
screen so that the buttons would be vertical while on the larger screen the 
buttons would be horizontal. We used a button tag to make the 
button work. We linked the buttons for the four pages. In addition bootstarp
css, javascript, html, and jquery.

A challenge that we ran into is that in the beginning is that we did have plenty of
ideas but we just didn't know how to do them. With the idea for this project we didn't
know how to actually do the code for the this project. But then afte wireframming we
found out ways to bring the project to life.

Something that I specfically learned was how to commit to git which I had a bit of trouble during
the first day as I didn't really understadn where to commit and how to commit. Thankfully two of the 
instructors taught me how to commit a project to git which I will use later on the future.

For now the next thing for this project is to finish the Food section in this project and add more
css to the Music Section
